6502 Emulator written in ANSI C

Start of a very basic 6502 emulator.

Still lots to do...

1) Find a good way to load in the roms into memory. 
2) Find a good way to simulate the registers for testing. 
3) Implement instructions.
4) Timing/CPU cycles. 
5) Maybe, don't use a "nasty" switch statement for fetch/excute cycle - maybe use C lookup table.
6) Interrupts
7) Maybe look at building a console emulator.
